# Roberto Hidalgo <[un@rob.mx](mailto:un@rob.mx)>

I work with computers, most of the time. Other times, during the last two decades, I have worked _around_, _despite_, and/or _with an intentional lack of_ computers. This is a longer version of my [résumé](/resume).

## Work Experience

### `2016...present` Staff Infrastructure Engineer at [Blink Health](https://www.blinkhealth.com)

Blink provides affordable and transparent access to medications for people in the United States. My focus at Blink has been at supporting the ever-growing development team in multiple locations.

- Introduced continuous delivery to a front-end team, alleviating the lack of trust by deploying fast and often. This began by speeding up local development builds by an order of magnitude; followed by instrumenting the app and deploys; and finally building automated "playgrounds" for developers to test their code (and our deploy process) in. <br /> `webpack` `nginx` `jenkins` `react` `datadog`, `sentry`
- Researched and iteratively implemented an onboarding process for engineers. As the company grew, I took the initiative to assemble a mixed group of engineers, human resources folks, and learning and development specialists to build a scalable process to get our newest teammates up to speed. After attending these sessions, which I've also facilitated, folks confidently navigate this growing system, and learn their way into using this team's toolchain. <br /> `bash` `homebrew` `github` `s3` `circleci`
- Adopted a bare-bones secrets management tool, developing its codebase along its fit within the team's workflow. Many RFCs, flavors of documentation pages, adopters, and languages later, I participated on building the internal process to [open source its code](https://github.com/blinkhealth/go-config-yourself), as well as the security review by a third party. <br /> `golang` `python` `typescript` `aws-kms` `gpg`
- Planned and implemented a gradual Infrastructure-as-Code introduction for our growing team along a cross-region cloud migration. Documented and facilitated learning sessions for different teams within the company. Built tools to bridge the gaps within our processes, until it made sense to use Terraform Enterprise. <br /> `terraform`, `packer`, `ansible` `python` `circleci` `python`

### `2010...2016` Lead Engineer at [Partido Surrealista Mexicano](https://surrealista.mx)

The _Mexican Surrealist Party_ was a software development agency I co-founded that worked on a variety of domains for its clients. Our small operation meant I built my experience throughout every step of the software development lifecycle.

- Architected and implemented a hardware and software turn-key solution for live video processing and delivery, also training our client's production teams. Served hundreds of thousands of hours of content from multiple newsrooms to the wide range of devices with a much lower budget months before the competition could catch up. <br /> `c` `ruby` `javascript` `html` `css` `mysql` `ffmpeg`
- Built, tested, documented, and launched the backend for a near-real-time seismic alert system, working closely with the Azure Mobile Services team during their service's early development. Delivered a reliable and increasingly trusted system that has continued to evolve from the initial implementation. <br /> `javascript` `ruby` `mssql`
- Led the continuous user research and development of a bespoke ERM for a rapidly growing immigration law firm. Employee retention rates, along their measured efficiency improved significantly as a result. Oversaw the system's painless integration and eventual migration after the firm's acquisition. <br /> `ruby` `sinatra` `html` `mongodb` `new-relic`

### `2001...2010` CTO at [Comtelsat](http://www.comtelsat.com.mx/?lang=en)

Comtelsat is an international film, broadcast, and security systems integrator for the private and public sector. During my time at Comtelsat, I wore many hats as the company expanded and found more markets to address, from leading government procurement processes to on-site technical implementation of solutions.


- Coordinated the growth of the operation and internal systems of the company from 7 people well into the thousands, selecting and negotiating vendors. Oversaw the implementation and rapid expansion of the company's operations cross-country and then abroad.
- Designed and implemented control-room automation systems and encryption solutions for multiple clients, including the largest Spanish-speaking media conglomerates of early 2000s. Monitored and operated these systems during mission-critical events like elections and global telenovela premieres.
- Built and oversaw the deployment of the National Airtime (_tiempos oficiales_) scheduling system used by every single media station in Mexico.

## Education

### `2005...2007` Visual Communication undergraduate at [Centro](https://centro.edu.mx)

I attended two years of the Visual Communication program at Centro, before dropping out.

Sharing knowledge is very important to me, within and outside the office space. I'm grateful to have helped grow a [Javascript community in Mexico City](http://www.meetup.com/eventloop), where I developed a knack for [telling stories](https://speakerdeck.com/unrob). I've lead courses for [Women Who Code DF](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Mexico-City/) and imparted summer classes for kids at [Christel House Mexico](http://mx.christelhouse.org). Through the years, I've mentored a handful of folks who have made blooming careers in tech for themselves.
