## Skills

### For deploying software reliably

- I pay a lot of attention to the flow of code from `git`, though CI/CD tooling like CircleCI, Jenkins and Github Actions, up to its deployment and testing.
- I tame clouds, including AWS, GPC and Azure, using their own tooling as well as `terraform`, `ansible`, `packer` and `docker`.
- When useful, I'll use `golang`, `python` and `bash` to automate workflows and think the unix philosophy is a great guide to it.
- The software I deploy becomes operable through the available information of it through logging, metrics and tracing; I've used `new relic`, `honeycomb`, `sentry`, the `elk` stack, `splunk` and `datadog` for that.

### For building software as a team

- As a long time self-directed learner, I value sharing available context in different ways; inline documentation only goes so far, and I've found RFCs, talks, guides, and sharing sessions are invaluable at enable self-directed learning in others.
- Being thought of as the person to reach to when hitting a wall is what makes me feel the proudest, I love pair-debugging with folks, participating in postmortems, and will happily do a week of on-call.
- Getting up to speed with a new team is a challenge I enjoy helping with; I've developed and then facilitated training sessions, building tools to automate and maintain developer's setup.
- My favorite hobby at work is to write tools that will make my team's work easier to accomplish, but know that's half of the work. The other half I like even better: to document them, introduce them to both codebases and my fellow teammates, and even open sourcing them!

### For the web

- I write software for the web with `ruby`, `python`, `javascript`, `php`, `html` and `css`.
- I've learned why not to build frameworks for some of these using `django`, `sinatra`, `rails`, `express`, and `react` instead.
- The systems I've built have been backed by data stores like `mysql`, `postgres`, `redis`, `dynamodb` and `mongodb`.
- `http` feels like home to me, and I understand `websockets`, REST, `tls`, and `graphql` reasonably well; I prefer `curl` over `wget`.
- Traversing the stack is easy for me, I enjoy writing UIs as much as APIs, thinking of caching, CDNs, DNS, service workers, data store querying, and everything in between has become second nature.
