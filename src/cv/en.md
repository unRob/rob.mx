# Roberto Hidalgo <[un@rob.mx](mailto:un@rob.mx)>

A generalist software engineer with an aptitude for learning voraciously, working at/around/despite/on/with computers for nearly two decades. 

Roberto thrives within teams that value knowledge sharing and collaboration through understanding; he loves making tools for them and debugging with them. He has no trouble referring to himself in the third person. As you can see, his pronouns are he/him; his plants currently call Brooklyn home.

## What is Roberto good at?

## Where has he worked?

**[Blink Health](https://www.blinkhealth.com)** (2016...): Blink provides affordable and transparent access to medications for people in the United States. Roberto joined the Front-end team devoted to transform the team's perspective on continuous delivery. He became an initial member of the Infrastructure team focused on improving developer's experience, address frustrations of chasing a fast-moving product, and continuously improving the system's operability and observability.

**[Partido Surrealista Mexicano](https://surrealista.mx/)** (2010-2016): The _Mexican Surrealist Party_ was a software development agency that worked on a variety of domains for its clients. Roberto and his co-founder directed a small team of developers providing services and turn-key products to clients like museums, NGOs, newspapers and immigration attorneys. Roberto led the development and implementation of the agency's software products alongside clients and end-users.

**[Comtelsat](http://www.comtelsat.com.mx/?lang=en)** (2001-2010): Comtelsat is a broadcast systems integrator where Roberto coordinated the growth of the IT processes and infrastructure of a 7 person company well into the thousands, while also researching, planning, and implementing software and hardware for the company's public and private sector clients, including some of the largest Spanish-speaking media conglomerates.

## What sorts of projects has he worked on?

These are a few projects from this decade Roberto feels pretty happy about.

**A hands-off approach to on-boarding engineers**. A couple lines of `bash` and a handy guide take newly hired developers on an adventure to self-configure tools and credentials, while getting to know some of the basic mechanics of our working environment. Before they know it, `node` and `python` toolchains get bootstrapped, accounts get created and passwords managed, `ssh` and `gpg` keys are unceremoniously created and trust is verified by their first pull request. CI kicks in once the _PR_ is approved, and provisioning accounts. There's, of course, a guide _on the guide_, so as the organization grows, the on-boarding process scales with it. Roberto mostly answers questions now.

**`config-yourself`**. This command line application and language-specific libraries allow the development teams to manage the secrets their codebase needs to run in multiple environments. It offers different cryptographic backends to address different concerns of security and compliance, and has been working silently in production for 2 years now. Roberto consolidated multiple efforts around this objective and has continuously improved the tools, hoping to open source it soon.

**End-to-End Video delivery platform**. The agency's first project had him build software and hardware to power the capture, processing, recording, distribution and playback of live and on-demand video streams to any device. Five years later, the system had evolved into a pipeline relying on AWS fed by custom-built video capture and transcoding hardware, allowing growing news teams to deliver on-demand and live video with little to no training from the newsroom and beyond.

**SkyAlert**. Participated in the development of this seismic alert app, where he designed and built the RESTful API, near-real time alerting system, its testing and documenting mechanisms, and worked with the mobile devs on debugging and polishing. Roberto routed through hardware interface issues all the way to availability problems with the then early version of Azure Mobile Services for a very successful launch.

## Who has Roberto learned from?

Roberto has collaborated with different communities and organizations throughout the years, both the organized and the less-than-formal ones. He has helped grow a [Javascript community in Mexico City](http://www.meetup.com/eventloop), [gave talks](https://speakerdeck.com/unrob) at times, helped mentor for [Women Who Code DF](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Mexico-City/) and imparted summer classes at [Christel House Mexico](http://mx.christelhouse.org).

There's also the handful of folks he's mentored that have successfully transitioned to a programming career through the years, both within and outside the office space. He has his mother—once a pre-k teacher—to thank for that.

Roberto completed his institutionalized education with an incomplete undergraduate degree in Visual Communication (2005-2007); he can speak Spanish, English and Brazilian Portuguese.
