Presently playing as a _senior software engineer_ at [Blink Health](https://www.blinkhealth.com), a company focused on making medicines affordable for people in the United States. 

## Work Highlights

### [BlinkHealth](https://blinkhealth.com) (2016...)

My main focus has been to improve our developers' experience through tools and processes. I've faced many interesting challenges, like reducing to minutes the time to deploy our apps, and implementing a secure config process and toolset across our platforms. — _js, python, shell, go_

### [SkyAlert](http://skyalert.mx/app/) (2015)

Participated in the development of this seismic alert app, where I built the RESTful API, its testing and documenting mechanisms, and worked with the mobile devs on debugging and polishing. Pushed through hardware interface issues all the way to availability problems with the then early version of Azure Mobile Services for a very successful launch. — _Mostly node.js, some ruby here and there_.

### [Representantes Patito](http://representantes.pati.to) (2013)

Figuring out who your elected representatives are is a mind-bogglingly complex process; I built this civic-oriented web-app, scraper, and RESTful API to simplify it into a one-step process. Had to reverse engineer several congress' websites to obtain pictures, contact details, assistance/voting records and sanitize the horrors that shall remain unspoken of the government-produced HTML I've seen. — _Ruby (sinatra), mongodb, and js_.

### End-to-end Video Platform (2011)

Our agency's first project had us build software and hardware to power the capture, processing, recording, distribution and playback of live and on-demand video streams to any device. The system evolved from a simple ftp server log parser and `ffmpeg` hackery, into a consumer of AWS services connected to custom-built streaming hardware. — _A ton of php, js, objective-c, ruby_.

Before April 2010 I worked for [Comtelsat](http://comtelsat.com), where I coordinated the growth of the IT processes and infrastructure of a 7 person company well into the thousands, while also researching, planning, and implementing software and hardware for the company's public and private sector clients. Projects varied wildly: networking of a tv studio, automated media monitoring, or the national airtime scheduling system.


## After a good day's work

I'm part of the team that organizes the 1600-people strong [Javascript community in Mexico City](http://www.meetup.com/eventloop), planning and hosting [monthly events](https://github.com/eventloop/platicas) focused on javascript.

I [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/unrob) regularly at the open-data, ruby, civic-hacking and javascript community events, participating as well in forums such as Microsoft's 2015 Innovation Fest.

Some of my time is devoted to mentoring, both individuals and groups with organizations such as [Women Who Code DF](https://github.com/WWCFD) and [Christel House Mexico](http://mx.christelhouse.org).

Finally, here's some of my favorite side projects:

- [Rob listens](https://rob.mx/escucha): Born out of curiosity for React, and my music listening habits.
- [api.rob.mx](https://github.com/unRob/api.rob.mx): A public log of stats about my behavior online.
